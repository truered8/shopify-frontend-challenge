# Spacestagram

Welcome to Spacestagram - a social media app for celestial objects. See the live demo at: [https://spacestagram.saptarshi.ml](https://spacestagram.saptarshi.ml).  
This website was made for the [Shopify Frontend Developer Intern Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13zXpyrC2yGxoLXKktxw2VJG2Jw8SdUfliLM-bYQLjqE/edit#).

## Tools Used

This website was developed using React.js. The [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is used to manage data, and all components are written as function components using [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Some other tools used include [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for pre-made components, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) for hosting, and the [NASA Image and Video API](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf) for images.
